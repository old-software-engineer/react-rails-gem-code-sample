# Concept

## React on Rails Gem

- `React-rails` gem allow us to use React in Rails framework.
- Automatically renders React server-side and client-side.
- Lets you use `JSX`, `ES6`.


### Star Rating 

- A simple react component for adding a star rating to the project.


### Styled-Component
- Styled-components lets you write actual `CSS` in your `JavaScript`. This means you can use all the features of `CSS` you use including (but by far not limited to) media queries, all pseudo-selectors, nesting, etc.


## Association

- **has_many Association** :

  A `has_many` association indicates a one-to-many connection with another model. This association indicates that   each instance of the model has zero or more instances of another model.
  
- **belongs_to Association** :

  A `belongs_to` association sets up a connection with another model, such that each instance of the declaring model "belongs to" one instance of the other model.

## Serializers
- Serializer converts an object in memory into a stream of bytes that can be recreated when needed. Serializers in Ruby on Rails convert a given object into a JSON format. Serializers control the particular attributes rendered when an object or model is converted into a JSON format.
